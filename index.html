        <h2>‚ôªÔ∏è Why Recycle E-Waste?</h2>
        <p>Recycling e-waste helps reduce landfill waste, prevents toxic pollution, and conserves valuable materials like gold, silver, and copper.Recycling e-waste is seen as a sustainable alternative to compensate for the limited natural rare earth elements (REEs) resources and the difficulty of accessing these resources. Recycling facilitates the recovery of valuable products and minimizes emissions during their transportation. Numerous studies have been reported on e-waste recycling using various techniques, including thermo-, hydro- and biometallurgical approaches. However, each approach still has technical, economic, social, or environmental limitations. This review highlights the potential of recycling e-waste, including outlining the current unutilized potential of REE recycling from different e-waste components. An in-depth analysis of e-waste generation on a global scale and Australian scenario, along with various hazardous impacts on ecosystem and human health, is reported. In addition, a comprehensive summary of various metal recovery processes and their merits and demerits is also presented. Lifecycle analysis for recovering REEs from e-waste indicate a positive environmental impact when compared to REEs produced from virgin sources. In addition, recovering REEs form secondary sources eliminated ca. 1.5 times radioactive waste, as seen in production from primary sources scenario. The review outcome demonstrates the increasing potential of REE recycling to overcome critical challenges, including issues over supply security and localized dependency.</p>
